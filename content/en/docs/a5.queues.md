# Queues in Kotlin

![Queues](https://dsakt.github.io/images/cover/Queues.png)


## 1. **Introduction**

Queues are a foundational data structure in computer science, designed to store and process elements in a specific order. Unlike stacks, queues operate on the **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)** principle, meaning elements are added at the end and removed from the front.

In Kotlin, queues are part of the `kotlin.collections` package and come with efficient implementations for different use cases, including **double-ended queues (Deque)** and linked lists. These implementations provide robust support for both FIFO and LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) operations.

---

## 2. **Overview of Queues**

### Definition and Purpose

A **queue** is a collection designed to process elements in the order they are added. Kotlin offers several ways to implement queues, such as:

- **`Queue<T>`**: Represents a collection with FIFO behavior.
- **`ArrayDeque<T>`**: A double-ended queue that allows operations on both ends efficiently.
- **`LinkedList<T>`**: A doubly linked list that also supports `Queue<T>` and `Deque<T>` functionalities.

### Key Characteristics

- **FIFO Order**: Elements are processed in the order they are added.
- **Dynamic Sizing**: Queues dynamically resize to accommodate varying numbers of elements.
- **Efficient Operations**: Kotlin's queue implementations provide optimized methods for insertion and removal.

### Common Scenarios

- Task scheduling (e.g., managing tasks in a printer queue).
- Handling asynchronous data streams.
- Breadth-first search (BFS) in graph algorithms.

## 3. **Kotlin Implementations**

### Types of Queues

#### 1. **Queue Interface (`Queue<T>`)**

The `Queue<T>` interface defines the standard contract for a queue in Kotlin. It provides methods for enqueuing, dequeuing, and peeking elements.

Key methods include:

- `add(element: T)`: Adds an element to the queue.
- `remove()`: Removes and returns the front element.
- `peek()`: Returns the front element without removing it.

#### Example:

```kotlin
val queue: Queue<Int> = LinkedList()
queue.add(1)
queue.add(2)
queue.add(3)

println(queue.remove())  // Output: 1
println(queue.peek())    // Output: 2
```

#### 2. **ArrayDeque (`ArrayDeque<T>`)**

`ArrayDeque<T>` is a double-ended queue (Deque) that provides efficient operations at both ends. It is implemented using a resizable array, making it highly performant for most queue operations.

Key features:

- Operations like `addFirst`, `addLast`, `removeFirst`, and `removeLast` are available.
- Suitable for both FIFO and LIFO operations.

#### Example:

```kotlin
val deque = ArrayDeque<String>()
deque.addLast("A")
deque.addLast("B")
deque.addFirst("C")

println(deque.removeFirst())  // Output: C
println(deque.removeLast())   // Output: B
```

#### 3. **LinkedList (`LinkedList<T>`)**

`LinkedList<T>` is a doubly linked list that can function as both a `Queue<T>` and a `Deque<T>`. It is ideal for scenarios where frequent insertion and deletion of elements are required.

Key features:

- Provides efficient insertion and removal at both ends.
- Implements both `Queue` and `Deque` interfaces.

#### Example:

```kotlin
val linkedList = LinkedList<Int>()
linkedList.add(10)
linkedList.add(20)
linkedList.add(30)

println(linkedList.remove())  // Output: 10
println(linkedList.peek())    // Output: 20
```

## 4. **How to Use Queues**

### Creating and Initializing Queues

#### Using `ArrayDeque`

```kotlin
val queue = ArrayDeque<String>()
queue.add("Kotlin")
queue.add("Java")
queue.add("Python")
```

#### Using `LinkedList`

```kotlin
val queue = LinkedList<Int>()
queue.add(1)
queue.add(2)
queue.add(3)
```

### Enqueuing and Dequeuing Elements

#### Adding Elements

Use `add()` or `offer()` to enqueue elements:

```kotlin
val queue = ArrayDeque<String>()
queue.add("Task1")
queue.add("Task2")
```

#### Removing Elements

Use `remove()` or `poll()` to dequeue elements:

```kotlin
println(queue.remove())  // Output: Task1
```

### Peeking Elements

Use `peek()` to view the front element without removing it:

```kotlin
println(queue.peek())  // Output: Task2
```

## 5. **Performance and Best Practices**

### Performance Considerations

- **`ArrayDeque`**: Offers faster performance for most use cases due to its array-based implementation.
- **`LinkedList`**: Ideal for scenarios requiring frequent insertions and deletions.

### Best Practices

1. **Choose the Right Implementation**: Use `ArrayDeque` for general-purpose queues and `LinkedList` for complex operations involving frequent middle insertions.
2. **Avoid Null Values**: Ensure that the queue does not contain nulls to prevent unexpected errors.
3. **Leverage Interfaces**: Use `Queue<T>` or `Deque<T>` as the reference type for flexibility.

---

## 6. **Examples and Use Cases**

### Example 1: Task Scheduling

```kotlin
val taskQueue = ArrayDeque<String>()
taskQueue.add("Task1")
taskQueue.add("Task2")
taskQueue.add("Task3")

while (taskQueue.isNotEmpty()) {
    println("Processing: ${taskQueue.remove()}")
}
```

### Example 2: Breadth-First Search (BFS)

```kotlin
fun bfs(graph: Map<Int, List<Int>>, start: Int) {
    val queue: Queue<Int> = LinkedList()
    val visited = mutableSetOf<Int>()

    queue.add(start)
    visited.add(start)

    while (queue.isNotEmpty()) {
        val current = queue.remove()
        println("Visited: $current")

        for (neighbor in graph[current] ?: emptyList()) {
            if (neighbor !in visited) {
                queue.add(neighbor)
                visited.add(neighbor)
            }
        }
    }
}

val graph = mapOf(1 to listOf(2, 3), 2 to listOf(4, 5), 3 to listOf(6))
bfs(graph, 1)
```

## 7. **Similar Data Structures**

### Queue vs Stack

- **Queue**: Follows FIFO order.
- **Stack**: Follows LIFO order.

### Queue vs PriorityQueue

- **Queue**: Processes elements in the order they are added.
- **PriorityQueue**: Processes elements based on their priority.

## 8. **Conclusion**

Queues in Kotlin are versatile and efficient for handling ordered collections. Whether you need to manage tasks, process data streams, or implement algorithms, Kotlin provides robust queue implementations. Choose the right implementation based on your requirements to write clean, efficient, and scalable code.
