# Sets in Kotlin

![Sets](https://dsakt.github.io/images/cover/Sets.png)


## 1. **Introduction**

Sets are a fundamental collection type in programming, designed to store unique elements. Unlike lists, sets do not maintain a specific order and disallow duplicate values, making them ideal for scenarios where uniqueness is essential.

In Kotlin, sets are part of the `kotlin.collections` package and come with robust features like immutability by default, concise syntax, and extensive support for functional programming.

## 2. **Overview of Sets**

### Definition and Purpose

A **set** is an unordered collection of unique elements. Kotlin offers two primary types of sets:

- **`Set<T>`**: A read-only set.
- **`MutableSet<T>`**: A set that supports modification operations such as adding or removing elements.

### Key Characteristics

- **Uniqueness**: Sets do not allow duplicate elements.
- **Unordered**: Elements are not guaranteed to maintain any specific order (except in specific implementations like `LinkedHashSet`).
- **No Index-Based Access**: Unlike lists, sets do not support accessing elements by index.

### Common Scenarios

- Ensuring uniqueness in a collection (e.g., email addresses, IDs).
- Fast membership testing (e.g., checking if an element exists in the collection).
- Performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

## 3. **Kotlin Implementations**

### Types of Sets

#### 1. **Immutable Set (`Set<T>`)**

An immutable set is read-only and cannot be modified after its creation.

The `setOf()` function creates a **read-only** set. Once created, its elements cannot be modified.

```kotlin
val set = setOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
println(set)  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

This set contains 5 integers, and the elements are unique. If you try to add a duplicate element, it will not be added.

```kotlin
val set = setOf(1, 2, 2, 3)
println(set)  // Output: [1, 2, 3]  (duplicates are ignored)
```

You can also create sets with other data types, such as `String` or custom objects:

```kotlin
val stringSet = setOf("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry")
println(stringSet)  // Output: [Apple, Banana, Cherry]

data class Student(val name: String, val grade: Int)
val studentSet = setOf(Student("Alice", 90), Student("Bob", 85), Student("Alice", 90))
println(studentSet)  // Output: [Student(name=Alice, grade=90), Student(name=Bob, grade=85)]
```
`

#### 2. **Mutable Set (`MutableSet<T>`)**

`mutableSetOf()` creates a **mutable** set, meaning you can add or remove elements after its creation.

```kotlin
val mutableSet = mutableSetOf(1, 2, 3)
mutableSet.add(4)  // Adding a new element
mutableSet.remove(2)  // Removing an element
println(mutableSet)  // Output: [1, 3, 4]
```

In this case, we created a mutable set and then added and removed elements.

A mutable set can also start as an empty set and have elements added later:

```kotlin
val emptyMutableSet = mutableSetOf<String>()
emptyMutableSet.add("Kotlin")
emptyMutableSet.add("Java")
println(emptyMutableSet)  // Output: [Kotlin, Java]
```

Mutable sets of custom objects can also be created and modified:

```kotlin
val studentMutableSet = mutableSetOf<Student>()
studentMutableSet.add(Student("Charlie", 88))
studentMutableSet.add(Student("Dana", 92))
println(studentMutableSet)  // Output: [Student(name=Charlie, grade=88), Student(name=Dana, grade=92)]
```

### Specialized Variants

1. **`HashSet<T>`**: A standard set backed by a hash table, offering constant-time complexity for basic operations.
2. **`LinkedHashSet<T>`**: Maintains the insertion order of elements.
3. **`TreeSet<T>`**: A sorted set based on a comparator or natural ordering (requires Java interop).

## 4. **How to Use Sets**

### Creating and Initializing Sets

#### Immutable Sets

```kotlin
val fruits = setOf("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry")
```

#### Mutable Sets

```kotlin
val fruits = mutableSetOf("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry")
```

#### Empty Sets

```kotlin
val emptySet = emptySet<String>()
val emptyMutableSet = mutableSetOf<String>()
```

### Adding and Removing Elements (MutableSet Only)

For **mutable sets**, you can perform several modification operations such as:

- **Adding Elements**: Use `add()` to add a new element.
- **Removing Elements**: Use `remove()` to remove an element.
- **Clearing the Set**: Use `clear()` to remove all elements from the set.

```kotlin
val mutableSet = mutableSetOf(1, 2, 3)
mutableSet.add(4)  // Adds element 4
mutableSet.remove(2)  // Removes element 2
println(mutableSet)  // Output: [1, 3, 4]

mutableSet.clear()  // Clears all elements
println(mutableSet)  // Output: []
```

### Iterating Over a Set

#### Using `for` Loop

```kotlin
for (fruit in fruits) {
    println(fruit)
}
```

#### Using `forEach`

```kotlin
fruits.forEach { println(it) }
```

## 5. **Set Variants in Kotlin**

Kotlin provides several variants of the `Set` interface, each designed to meet specific requirements for handling collections of unique elements. Understanding these variants helps in choosing the right one for your use case.

### **HashSet**

`HashSet` is an unordered collection of elements that does not allow duplicates. It uses a hash table for storage, which provides excellent performance for insertion, deletion, and access operations. However, because it does not maintain the order of insertion, the elements can appear in any order when iterated.

#### **Creating a HashSet**

```kotlin
val hashSet = HashSet<String>()
hashSet.add("Apple")
hashSet.add("Banana")
hashSet.add("Apple")  // Duplicate, will not be added

println(hashSet)  // Output: [Apple, Banana]
```

#### **Key Characteristics of HashSet**
- **Unordered**: The order of elements is not maintained. Iterating over the set will not yield elements in the order they were added.
- **No Duplicates**: Each element in the set must be unique. If a duplicate is added, it will be ignored.
- **Performance**: Provides fast access, insertion, and deletion times (average O(1) for all three operations) due to the underlying hash table implementation.

### **LinkedHashSet**

`LinkedHashSet` is a variant of `HashSet` that maintains the order of insertion. This means that elements are iterated in the order they were added, which can be useful when you need to preserve the sequence of elements, such as in a recently accessed items list or when the order of input matters.

#### **Creating a LinkedHashSet**

```kotlin
val linkedHashSet = LinkedHashSet<String>()
linkedHashSet.add("Apple")
linkedHashSet.add("Banana")
linkedHashSet.add("Apple")  // Duplicate, will not be added

println(linkedHashSet)  // Output: [Apple, Banana]
```

#### **Key Characteristics of LinkedHashSet**
- **Maintains Insertion Order**: Unlike `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet` preserves the order of elements as they were inserted.
- **No Duplicates**: Just like `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet` does not allow duplicates.
- **Performance**: While it maintains order, the performance characteristics are still close to those of `HashSet` (average O(1) for access, O(n) for iteration due to the linked list).

### **SortedSet**

`SortedSet` is an interface that represents a collection where the elements are sorted in ascending order (or descending, based on a comparator). It is useful when you need to iterate over the elements in a sorted manner, such as for displaying sorted data or processing items in order.

#### **Creating a SortedSet**

```kotlin
val sortedSet = sortedSetOf("Banana", "Apple", "Cherry")
println(sortedSet)  // Output: [Apple, Banana, Cherry]
```

#### **Key Characteristics of SortedSet**
- **Sorted Order**: The elements are ordered in ascending order (or based on a custom comparator if provided).
- **No Duplicates**: Similar to other set variants, `SortedSet` does not allow duplicates.
- **Performance**: The sorting operation can affect performance; however, it allows for efficient searching, updating, and deletion of elements in a sorted manner (average O(log n) for access).

## 6. **Set Extensions**

Kotlin provides a rich set of extension functions for performing common set operations. Here are some of the most useful ones:

- **`filter`**: Filters elements based on a predicate.

  ```kotlin
  val evenNumbers = setOf(1, 2, 3, 4).filter { it % 2 == 0 }
  println(evenNumbers) // Output: [2, 4]
  ```

- **`union`**: Combines two sets into one.

  ```kotlin
  val set1 = setOf(1, 2, 3)
  val set2 = setOf(3, 4, 5)
  val unionSet = set1 union set2
  println(unionSet) // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  ```

- **`intersect`**: Returns the common elements between two sets.

  ```kotlin
  val set1 = setOf(1, 2, 3)
  val set2 = setOf(2, 3, 4)
  val intersection = set1 intersect set2
  println(intersection) // Output: [2, 3]
  ```

- **`subtract`**: Returns the difference between two sets.

  ```kotlin
  val set1 = setOf(1, 2, 3)
  val set2 = setOf(2, 3, 4)
  val difference = set1 subtract set2
  println(difference) // Output: [1]
  ```

## 7. **Performance and Best Practices**

### Performance Considerations

- **Membership Testing**: Sets offer O(1) performance for `HashSet` and O(log n) for `TreeSet`.
- **Insertion/Deletion**: Fast for `HashSet`, slightly slower for ordered implementations like `LinkedHashSet` or `TreeSet`.

### Best Practices

1. **Prefer Immutability**: Use `Set` for collections that don’t change after initialization.
2. **Choose the Right Implementation**: Use `HashSet` for general-purpose use and `LinkedHashSet` when maintaining order is important.
3. **Use Extension Functions**: Simplify common operations with functions like `union`, `intersect`, and `filter`.
4. **Leverage Set Operations**: Use built-in operations instead of manual iterations for better readability and efficiency.

## 8. **Code Examples**

### Example 1: Checking for Uniqueness

```kotlin
val emails = setOf("a@example.com", "b@example.com", "a@example.com")
println(emails.size) // Output: 2
```

### Example 2: Performing Set Operations

```kotlin
val setA = setOf(1, 2, 3)
val setB = setOf(3, 4, 5)

val union = setA union setB
val intersection = setA intersect setB
val difference = setA subtract setB

println("Union: $union")        // Output: Union: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
println("Intersection: $intersection") // Output: Intersection: [3]
println("Difference: $difference")     // Output: Difference: [1, 2]
```

### Example 3: Filtering a Set

```kotlin
val numbers = setOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val oddNumbers = numbers.filter { it % 2 != 0 }
println(oddNumbers) // Output: [1, 3, 5]
```

## 9. **Similar Data Structures**

### Set vs List

- **Set**: Ensures uniqueness, does not maintain order (unless using `LinkedHashSet`).
- **List**: Allows duplicates and maintains order.

### Set vs Map

- **Set**: Stores unique elements.
- **Map**: Stores key-value pairs where keys must be unique.
