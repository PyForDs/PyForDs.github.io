> Instead, it’s my personal understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms in the context of Kotlin. 
> My goal is to explain what I know and understand in simple terms, making these concepts accessible to everyone.

## **A Little Background**

I’m not from a Software Engineering or Computer Science academic background. Tech has always been my passion. Learning programming and software development was a completely **self-taught journey**, using various online resources.

I worked on Android development using Java for a long time before transitioning to Kotlin in 2022. To be honest, I was never really a fan of DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms). I didn’t focus much on competitive programming or DSA problem-solving on platforms like **LeetCode** or **HackerRank**.

In day-to-day development work, solving DSA problems isn’t always a priority. Most tasks revolve around **UI design, APIs, and other practical implementation details**. However, companies often look for developers who are not only experts in a specific tech stack but also proficient in DSA.

This realization led me to dedicate a couple of months to solving DSA problems. While there are many general DSA tutorials available, I found very little structured or organized content specific to Kotlin. That’s where the idea for **DSA.kt** came from—not only as a resource for others but also as a **reference for myself whenever I need a quick memory refresh**.

I started this platform to address the challenges I faced while learning DSA in Kotlin, aiming to create a resource I wish I had when I started.


## **About Me**

> Hi, I'm **K M Rejowan Ahmmed**, an **Android Developer** based in **Dhaka, Bangladesh** with over **5 years of experience**. I specialize in building Android apps using **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, and other modern Android tools. I also create content to help others learn Android development and Kotlin.

## **What is DSA.kt?**

**DSA.kt** is a website I created using **Hugo** and the **E25DX Hugo theme** as a platform to learn and explore **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** specifically in the context of **Kotlin**.

The goal of **DSA.kt** is to provide a structured and organized approach to learning:
- **Data Structures**: Covering both foundational and advanced data structures, with a focus on their practical implementation using Kotlin.
- **Algorithms**: Detailed explanations of algorithms, including their step-by-step implementation in Kotlin. This includes essential topics like sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, and graph traversal.
- **Problem-Solving Techniques**: Strategies and methods to approach coding problems efficiently, with clean and concise Kotlin code.

This platform is more than just a collection of tutorials; it’s a resource designed to simplify complex concepts and provide **Kotlin-specific solutions**. The content is crafted to help developers not only **understand the theory** behind DSA but also **apply these concepts effectively** in coding interviews and real-world projects.

Whether you’re preparing for an interview, improving your problem-solving skills, or simply curious about DSA in Kotlin, **DSA.kt** is here to support your learning journey.
